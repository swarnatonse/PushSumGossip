# PushSumGossip

Gossip Algorithm and Push Sum algorithm are implemented for four different types of topologies
- Line Topology
- Full Network Topology
- 3D Grid
- Imperfect 3D Grid

Input is provided in the form project2.scala numNodes topology algorithm
Where numNodes is the number of actors, topology is one of the topologies mentioned above and algorithm is gossip or push sum

Both algorithms are working for all topologies

The largest network managed is as follows
Gossip Algorithm:
Line: 2600
Full: 2500
3D Grid: 2500
Imperfect 3D Grid: 2500
Push Sum:
Line: 2100
Full: 2000
3D Grid: 2100
Imperfect 3D Grid: 2000
